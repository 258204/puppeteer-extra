### [addExtra(launcher)](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/3dd22d546eb9d9a47feca4800ed3cf0fda52107c/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L20-L22)

- `launcher` **types.PuppeteerBrowserLauncher** Puppeteer (or compatible) browser launcher

Returns: **types.PuppeteerExtra**

Augment the provided Puppeteer with plugin functionality.

Using `addExtra` will always create a fresh PuppeteerExtra instance.

Example:

```javascript
import vanillaPuppeteer from 'puppeteer'
import { addExtra } from 'puppeteer-extra

const puppeteer = addExtra(vanillaPuppeteer)
puppeteer.use(plugin)
```

### [defaultExport()](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/3dd22d546eb9d9a47feca4800ed3cf0fda52107c/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L45-L48)

The **default export** will behave exactly the same as the regular puppeteer
(just with extra plugin functionality) and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

Behind the scenes it will try to require either `puppeteer`
or `puppeteer-core` from the installed dependencies.

Please note that due to imports being cached this will result in a single
PuppeteerExtra instance, even when used in different files. If you need multiple
instances (e.g. different plugins) please use `addExtra`.

Example:

```javascript
// javascript import
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra')

// typescript/es6 module import
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-extra'

// Add plugins
puppeteer.use(...)
```
