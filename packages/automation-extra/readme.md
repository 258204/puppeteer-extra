# automation-extra

WIP

- A rewrite of the `puppeteer-extra` plugin system to be driver agnostic and support both Puppeteer and Playwright.
- Currently not meant to be used directly but through `puppeteer-extra` and `playwright-extra`.
- Supports both legacy PuppeteerExtraPlugins as well as new AutomationExtraPlugins.
