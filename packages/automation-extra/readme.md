## WIP

New plugin framework to support both Playwright and Puppeteer.

**UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - NOT MEANT TO BE USED YET**

## Differences

- A rewrite of the `puppeteer-extra` plugin system to be driver agnostic and support both Puppeteer and Playwright.
- Currently not meant to be used directly but through `puppeteer-extra` and `playwright-extra`.
- Supports both legacy PuppeteerExtraPlugins as well as new AutomationExtraPlugins.
