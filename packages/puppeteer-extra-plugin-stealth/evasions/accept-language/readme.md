- `opts` (optional, default `{}`)

**Extends: PuppeteerExtraPlugin**

By default puppeteer will not set a `accept-language` header in headless.

It's (theoretically) possible to fix that using either `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders` or a `--lang` launch arg.
Unfortunately `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders` will lowercase everything and launch args are not always available. :)
As a solution we hook into the CDP protocol and add the header there in case it's missing (capitalized correctly).
