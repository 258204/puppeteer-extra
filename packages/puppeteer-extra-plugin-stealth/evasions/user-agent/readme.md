**Extends: PuppeteerExtraPlugin**

A small shim to require the `puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua` plugin.

Let's make use of `puppeteer-extra`'s modular nature and not re-invent things. :-)

Note: If you want to customize it's settings just require the above mentioned
plugin directly and specify your desired options, it won't be required if you already did so.
